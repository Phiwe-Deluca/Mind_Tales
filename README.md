# 🌀 MindTales

**MindTales** is a mood-driven digital journal and blog platform built for creators, dreamers, and developers who value introspection as much as innovation. Designed to blend expressive aesthetics with clean backend structure, this project reflects my personal learning journey one where code becomes storytelling.

## ✨ Design Inspiration

The visual direction and aesthetic style for **MindTales** was brought to life with creative guidance from **[Lovable.dev](https://www.loveable.dev/)** a playground for designers and dreamers building soulful software.

MindTales isn’t just about code it’s a rhythm, a ritual, and a reflection.
